# CSVHandler
This is a basic project for interacting with csv files. I wrote that after i did not find a simple API to interact with csvfiles

It can populate data to csvfile read from it filter it according to defiend criteria update rows if csv file and presist chages back to file.

This is a starter, with hardly no error handling done. Would like to continue improving it with the community
